    <h1>PNG vs JPG</h1>
    <p><strong>png vs jpg</strong> should be your first check before choosing a conversion path.</p>
    <p>PNG prioritizes lossless clarity and transparency; JPG usually wins on file size for photo-heavy pages.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>What is png vs jpg best for?</h2>
    <p><strong>png vs jpg</strong> is most useful when you need to balance quality, compatibility, and file size before publishing. Start from your destination channel requirements, confirm whether editing flexibility or playback reach matters more, then convert only once into the format that matches that decision.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>When PNG is the better choice</h2>
    <ul><li>UI screenshots with text overlays.</li><li>Graphics that require transparency.</li><li>Assets edited repeatedly before final export.</li></ul>

    <h2>When JPG is the better choice</h2>

    <h2>How to choose between PNG and JPG</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Define whether your priority is edit flexibility, cross-device compatibility, or smaller transfer size.</li>
      <li>Match that priority to the table below, then test one representative file in your real publishing workflow.</li>
      <li>Lock a default format policy and document when the alternate format is still required.</li>

    <h2>Advanced decision guidance for PNG vs JPG</h2>
    <p>PNG priority 1: UI screenshots with text overlays. This route is strongest when your team needs predictable quality control and can accept any workflow overhead required by PNG.</p>
<p>PNG priority 2: Graphics that require transparency. This route is strongest when your team needs predictable quality control and can accept any workflow overhead required by PNG.</p>
<p>PNG priority 3: Assets edited repeatedly before final export. This route is strongest when your team needs predictable quality control and can accept any workflow overhead required by PNG.</p>
    <p>JPG priority 1: Photo galleries and blog cover images. This route is strongest when compatibility, transfer speed, or downstream publishing constraints are the dominant business requirement.</p>
<p>JPG priority 2: Email-ready attachments with size limits. This route is strongest when compatibility, transfer speed, or downstream publishing constraints are the dominant business requirement.</p>
<p>JPG priority 3: Large media libraries where storage cost matters. This route is strongest when compatibility, transfer speed, or downstream publishing constraints are the dominant business requirement.</p>
