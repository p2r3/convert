    <h1>JPG vs WEBP</h1>
    <p><strong>jpg vs webp</strong> should be your first check before choosing a conversion path.</p>
    <p>WEBP typically delivers smaller files for similar visual quality, while JPG still wins on universal legacy compatibility.</p>

    <h2>What is jpg vs webp best for?</h2>
    <p><strong>jpg vs webp</strong> is most useful when you need to balance quality, compatibility, and file size before publishing. Start from your destination channel requirements, confirm whether editing flexibility or playback reach matters more, then convert only once into the format that matches that decision.</p>

    <h2>How to choose between JPG and WEBP</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Define whether your priority is edit flexibility, cross-device compatibility, or smaller transfer size.</li>
      <li>Match that priority to the table below, then test one representative file in your real publishing workflow.</li>
      <li>Lock a default format policy and document when the alternate format is still required.</li>
