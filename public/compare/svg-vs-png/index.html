    <h1>SVG vs PNG</h1>
    <p><strong>svg vs png</strong> should be your first check before choosing a conversion path.</p>
    <p>SVG scales infinitely and is ideal for line art and logos; PNG is safer for fixed-size image compatibility.</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>What is svg vs png best for?</h2>
    <p><strong>svg vs png</strong> is most useful when you need to balance quality, compatibility, and file size before publishing. Start from your destination channel requirements, confirm whether editing flexibility or playback reach matters more, then convert only once into the format that matches that decision.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>When SVG is the better choice</h2>
    <ul><li>Responsive logos and icons.</li><li>Design systems that require infinite scaling.</li><li>Small assets where editable vector source matters.</li></ul>

    <h2>When PNG is the better choice</h2>
    <ul><li>Channels that do not render SVG reliably.</li><li>Static social graphics and screenshots.</li><li>Workflows requiring predictable pixel output.</li></ul>

    <h2>How to choose between SVG and PNG</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Define whether your priority is edit flexibility, cross-device compatibility, or smaller transfer size.</li>
      <li>Match that priority to the table below, then test one representative file in your real publishing workflow.</li>
      <li>Lock a default format policy and document when the alternate format is still required.</li>

    <h2>Advanced decision guidance for SVG vs PNG</h2>
    <p>SVG priority 1: Responsive logos and icons. This route is strongest when your team needs predictable quality control and can accept any workflow overhead required by SVG.</p>
<p>SVG priority 2: Design systems that require infinite scaling. This route is strongest when your team needs predictable quality control and can accept any workflow overhead required by SVG.</p>
<p>SVG priority 3: Small assets where editable vector source matters. This route is strongest when your team needs predictable quality control and can accept any workflow overhead required by SVG.</p>
    <p>PNG priority 1: Channels that do not render SVG reliably. This route is strongest when compatibility, transfer speed, or downstream publishing constraints are the dominant business requirement.</p>
<p>PNG priority 2: Static social graphics and screenshots. This route is strongest when compatibility, transfer speed, or downstream publishing constraints are the dominant business requirement.</p>
<p>PNG priority 3: Workflows requiring predictable pixel output. This route is strongest when compatibility, transfer speed, or downstream publishing constraints are the dominant business requirement.</p>

    <h2>What teams learn after repeated svg vs png evaluations</h2>
    <p>Keyword angle 1: Queries around &quot;svg or png logo&quot; usually indicate buyers or operators evaluating long-term policy, not just one-off conversion output, so decision criteria should include edit lifecycle, storage cost, and distribution risk.</p>
<p>Keyword angle 2: Queries around &quot;vector vs raster image&quot; usually indicate buyers or operators evaluating long-term policy, not just one-off conversion output, so decision criteria should include edit lifecycle, storage cost, and distribution risk.</p>
<p>Keyword angle 3: Queries around &quot;svg png difference&quot; usually indicate buyers or operators evaluating long-term policy, not just one-off conversion output, so decision criteria should include edit lifecycle, storage cost, and distribution risk.</p>
    <p>Decision note 1: In infinite vector scaling behavior, prioritize SVG only when that choice directly supports your delivery constraints, stakeholder editing needs, and long-term storage policy without adding unnecessary re-encoding steps.</p>
<p>Decision note 2: In static raster social card output, prioritize PNG only when that choice directly supports your delivery constraints, stakeholder editing needs, and long-term storage policy without adding unnecessary re-encoding steps.</p>
<p>Decision note 3: In logo system source of truth, prioritize SVG only when that choice directly supports your delivery constraints, stakeholder editing needs, and long-term storage policy without adding unnecessary re-encoding steps.</p>
<p>Decision note 4: In line art sharpness retention, prioritize PNG only when that choice directly supports your delivery constraints, stakeholder editing needs, and long-term storage policy without adding unnecessary re-encoding steps.</p>
<p>Decision note 5: In pixel-grid export certainty, prioritize SVG only when that choice directly supports your delivery constraints, stakeholder editing needs, and long-term storage policy without adding unnecessary re-encoding steps.</p>
<p>Decision note 6: In svg render sandbox limitations, prioritize PNG only when that choice directly supports your delivery constraints, stakeholder editing needs, and long-term storage policy without adding unnecessary re-encoding steps.</p>
<p>Decision note 7: In email-safe image delivery, prioritize SVG only when that choice directly supports your delivery constraints, stakeholder editing needs, and long-term storage policy without adding unnecessary re-encoding steps.</p>
<p>Decision note 8: In icon font replacement strategy, prioritize PNG only when that choice directly supports your delivery constraints, stakeholder editing needs, and long-term storage policy without adding unnecessary re-encoding steps.</p>
<p>Decision note 9: In print and web dual workflow, prioritize SVG only when that choice directly supports your delivery constraints, stakeholder editing needs, and long-term storage policy without adding unnecessary re-encoding steps.</p>
<p>Decision note 10: In vector editing lifecycle, prioritize PNG only when that choice directly supports your delivery constraints, stakeholder editing needs, and long-term storage policy without adding unnecessary re-encoding steps.</p>
