    <h2>Advanced PNG to JPG execution notes</h2>
    <p>Quality control 1: Set JPG quality between 80 and 90 for balanced clarity. This matters because production handoffs fail when teams skip pre-publish checks and only notice format issues after distribution.</p>
<p>Quality control 2: Check text edges to avoid compression artifacts. This matters because production handoffs fail when teams skip pre-publish checks and only notice format issues after distribution.</p>
<p>Quality control 3: Keep the original PNG when transparency is required. This matters because production handoffs fail when teams skip pre-publish checks and only notice format issues after distribution.</p>
<p>Quality control 4: Rename output using descriptive image intent keywords. This matters because production handoffs fail when teams skip pre-publish checks and only notice format issues after distribution.</p>
    <p>Pitfall pattern 1: JPG removes alpha transparency. Mitigate this by running one representative sample through your full workflow, then documenting the exact setting profile used in successful output.</p>
<p>Pitfall pattern 2: Repeated JPG saves degrade quality. Mitigate this by running one representative sample through your full workflow, then documenting the exact setting profile used in successful output.</p>
<p>Pitfall pattern 3: Over-compression creates visible blocky noise. Mitigate this by running one representative sample through your full workflow, then documenting the exact setting profile used in successful output.</p>

    <h2>PNG to JPG direction-specific engineering notes</h2>
    <p>Direction-specific note 1: PNG to JPG workflows are usually chosen for distribution speed, not archival quality. Teams should preserve the source PNG in a master bucket, then export one delivery JPG tuned for the exact channel constraints.</p>
<p>Direction-specific note 2: When converting UI screenshots, text edges are the first place compression artifacts appear. A safer process is to test quality levels against 100% zoom before publishing to documentation or support portals.</p>
<p>Direction-specific note 3: Transparency handling must be planned explicitly. If the PNG has alpha regions, pre-define the fallback background color that matches your brand system so exports remain consistent across assets.</p>
<p>Direction-specific note 4: For web delivery, measure the delta between source and output size and track resulting page-weight reduction. This creates a repeatable policy for future image conversion decisions.</p>
