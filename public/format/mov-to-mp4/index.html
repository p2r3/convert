    <h2>Advanced MOV to MP4 execution notes</h2>
    <p>Quality control 1: Use H.264 video and AAC audio for compatibility. This matters because production handoffs fail when teams skip pre-publish checks and only notice format issues after distribution.</p>
<p>Quality control 2: Match frame rate with the original capture. This matters because production handoffs fail when teams skip pre-publish checks and only notice format issues after distribution.</p>
<p>Quality control 3: Check bitrate to balance size and quality. This matters because production handoffs fail when teams skip pre-publish checks and only notice format issues after distribution.</p>
<p>Quality control 4: Review final playback on at least two devices. This matters because production handoffs fail when teams skip pre-publish checks and only notice format issues after distribution.</p>
    <p>Pitfall pattern 1: Bitrate set too low introduces visible artifacts. Mitigate this by running one representative sample through your full workflow, then documenting the exact setting profile used in successful output.</p>
<p>Pitfall pattern 2: Variable frame rates can desync in some editors. Mitigate this by running one representative sample through your full workflow, then documenting the exact setting profile used in successful output.</p>
